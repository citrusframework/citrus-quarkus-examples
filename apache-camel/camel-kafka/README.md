# Apache Camel Kafka Integration Testing with Citrus

This example demonstrates how to test Apache Camel routes in Quarkus applications using Citrus framework with Kafka integration. The project showcases a simple Camel route that transforms incoming Kafka messages to uppercase and publishes them to an output topic.

## Why Citrus for Kafka Testing?

**When Quarkus Kafka Dev Services Don't Apply:**

Quarkus provides excellent Kafka Dev Services that automatically start a Kafka broker during development and testing. However, these dev services may not work for all Quarkus applications, particularly when:

- Using Apache Camel's native Kafka component
- Integrating with custom Kafka clients
- Requiring specific Kafka versions or configurations
- Testing legacy applications or specific integration patterns

Citrus provides the `@KafkaContainerSupport` annotation - a simple, declarative way to provision Kafka broker infrastructure for your integration tests:

```java
@KafkaContainerSupport(port = 9092, version = "4.2.0")
class QuarkusApplicationTest {
    // Your Kafka broker is ready - that's it!
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single annotation provides complete Kafka infrastructure
- ✅ Works with any Kafka client or framework (Camel, Spring Kafka, native clients)
- ✅ Automatic bootstrap server configuration shared across Quarkus, Camel, and test endpoints
- ✅ Real Apache Kafka (via Testcontainers), not mocks
- ✅ Customizable via container lifecycle listeners (topic creation, ACLs, etc.)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup after test execution

## The Application Under Test

The Quarkus application uses Apache Camel to implement a simple integration route with Kafka:

```
Kafka Topic (words-in) → Apache Camel Route (Transform) → Kafka Topic (words-out)
```

### Apache Camel Route

The application consists of a single, elegant Camel route defined in `Routes.java`:

```java
public class Routes extends EndpointRouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from(kafka("words-in").autoOffsetReset("earliest"))
            .setBody(exchange -> ">> " + exchange.getIn().getBody().toString().toUpperCase())
            .to(kafka("words-out"));
    }
}
```

**Route Breakdown:**

1. **from(kafka("words-in").autoOffsetReset("earliest"))**: Camel consumer that listens to the `words-in` Kafka topic
   - Uses the Endpoint DSL for type-safe route configuration
   - `.autoOffsetReset("earliest")` ensures the consumer reads from the beginning of the topic
2. **.setBody(...)**: Transformation step that:
   - Retrieves the message body from the exchange
   - Converts it to uppercase
   - Prefixes it with `">> "`
3. **to(kafka("words-out"))**: Camel producer that sends the transformed message to the `words-out` Kafka topic

### Camel Kafka Component Configuration

Quarkus automatically configures the Camel Kafka component to use the Kafka bootstrap servers. The `kafka:` prefix in the route definition (`from("kafka:words-in")`) references this pre-configured component, which:

- Uses the Kafka bootstrap servers configured in application.properties
- Supports automatic reconnection and error handling
- Integrates seamlessly with Camel's error handling
- Requires no additional configuration code

## Understanding the Citrus Test

The test class `QuarkusApplicationTest` demonstrates how to verify the end-to-end Camel route flow using Citrus framework.

### Test Setup: Kafka Container and Topic Creation

The test uses Citrus Testcontainers support to provision a Kafka broker and create topics.

**Important**: While Quarkus provides Kafka Dev Services for automatic Kafka broker provisioning, these dev services may not apply to all Quarkus applications (e.g., when using Apache Camel's Kafka component). In such cases, Citrus provides an alternative approach through the `@KafkaContainerSupport` annotation, which creates the required Kafka broker infrastructure for your integration tests with minimal configuration.

```java
@KafkaContainerSupport(
    port = 9092, 
    version = "4.2.0", 
    containerLifecycleListener = QuarkusApplicationTest.KafkaConfigurer.class)
class QuarkusApplicationTest implements TestActionSupport {

    public static class KafkaConfigurer implements ContainerLifecycleListener<KafkaContainer> {
        @Override
        public Map<String, String> started(KafkaContainer container) {
            try (Admin adminClient = Admin.create(...)) {
                adminClient.createTopics(Set.of(
                    new NewTopic("words-in", 1, (short) 1),
                    new NewTopic("words-out", 1, (short) 1)
                ));
            }
            return Collections.emptyMap();
        }
    }
}
```

**What's happening here:**

- `@KafkaContainerSupport`: Citrus annotation that starts a Kafka testcontainer with the specified version
  - **Alternative to Quarkus Kafka Dev Services**: When Quarkus Kafka Dev Services don't automatically apply to your application (e.g., when using Apache Camel's Kafka component directly), this annotation provides a simple, declarative way to provision a Kafka broker for testing
  - **Minimal Configuration**: Just add the annotation with the desired Kafka version - no additional setup required
  - **Automatic Cleanup**: The Kafka container is automatically stopped and cleaned up after test execution
- `containerLifecycleListener`: Custom listener that runs after the container starts
- `KafkaConfigurer`: Creates the required Kafka topics (`words-in` and `words-out`) before tests run
- The Kafka bootstrap servers are automatically configured and shared between:
  - Quarkus for application configuration
  - Apache Camel for the `kafka:` component  
  - Citrus for test endpoints
- This ensures all three frameworks communicate with the same Kafka broker instance

### Test Setup: Endpoint Configuration

Citrus uses annotations to declaratively configure Kafka endpoints:

```java
@CitrusEndpoint
@KafkaEndpointConfig(topic = "words-in")
KafkaEndpoint wordsIn;

@CitrusEndpoint
@KafkaEndpointConfig(topic = "words-out")
KafkaEndpoint wordsOut;
```

**What's happening here:**

- `@CitrusEndpoint`: Marks fields as Citrus test endpoints that will be automatically configured
- `@KafkaEndpointConfig`: Specifies the Kafka topic name
- The bootstrap servers are automatically resolved from the Citrus registry (registered via `@BindToRegistry`)
- Two endpoints are defined: one for sending messages to the Camel route (`wordsIn`) and one for receiving results (`wordsOut`)

### Test Annotations

The test class uses several key annotations:

```java
@QuarkusTest
@CitrusSupport
@KafkaContainerSupport(
    port = 9092, 
    version = "4.2.0", 
    containerLifecycleListener = QuarkusApplicationTest.KafkaConfigurer.class)
class QuarkusApplicationTest implements TestActionSupport {
    // ...
}
```

**What's happening here:**

- `@QuarkusTest`: Starts the Quarkus application (including Camel routes) in test mode
- `@CitrusSupport`: Enables Citrus framework integration with Quarkus
- `@KafkaContainerSupport`: **The key to Citrus-powered Kafka testing**
  - Automatically starts a Kafka testcontainer (version 4.2.0) for testing
  - **Use this when Quarkus Kafka Dev Services don't apply**: If your Quarkus application doesn't automatically benefit from Kafka Dev Services (e.g., when using Apache Camel, custom Kafka clients, or specific configurations), this annotation provides the Kafka infrastructure you need
  - **Single-annotation simplicity**: No need to manually configure testcontainers, create test resources, or manage broker lifecycle
- `containerLifecycleListener`: Specifies a custom listener to run after container startup (used to create topics)
- No manual broker setup required
- Automatic cleanup after test execution

### Test Execution: Gherkin-Style DSL

The actual test uses Citrus's Gherkin-style test runner for readable Given-When-Then syntax:

```java
@Test
void shouldHandleEvents() {
    runner.when(
        send()
            .endpoint(wordsIn)
            .message()
            .body("Howdy")
    );

    runner.then(
        receive()
            .endpoint(wordsOut)
            .message()
            .body(">> HOWDY")
    );
}
```

**Test Flow Breakdown:**

1. **WHEN**: Send a message with body `"Howdy"` to the `words-in` topic
2. The Camel route automatically consumes the message from `words-in`
3. The route transforms the message to `">> HOWDY"`
4. The route produces the message to the `words-out` topic
5. **THEN**: Verify that a message with body `">> HOWDY"` is received from the `words-out` topic

The test validates:
- The Camel route successfully consumes messages from the Kafka topic
- The transformation logic (uppercase conversion + prefix) works correctly
- The Camel route successfully produces messages to the output topic
- End-to-end integration between Kafka, Camel, and the application

## Key Testing Concepts

### 1. Citrus Testcontainers Kafka Support

The test uses Citrus's built-in Kafka testcontainer support via the `@KafkaContainerSupport` annotation.

**Why use Citrus `@KafkaContainerSupport` instead of Quarkus Kafka Dev Services?**

While Quarkus provides Kafka Dev Services that automatically start a Kafka broker during development and testing, these dev services may not work in all scenarios:

- **Apache Camel Kafka Component**: When using Camel's native Kafka component, Quarkus Dev Services may not automatically configure the broker connection
- **Custom Kafka Clients**: Applications using Kafka clients directly (not through Quarkus messaging) may require explicit broker configuration
- **Test-specific Requirements**: Integration tests may need precise control over Kafka version, configuration, or lifecycle

**Citrus `@KafkaContainerSupport` provides:**
- **Universal Kafka Infrastructure**: Works with any Kafka client or integration framework (Apache Camel, Spring Kafka, native clients, etc.)
- **Declarative Setup**: Single annotation creates a fully functional Kafka broker
- **Version Control**: Specify exact Kafka version for your tests (e.g., `version = "4.2.0"`)
- **Lifecycle Management**: Container lifecycle listeners for custom initialization (topic creation, ACL setup, etc.)
- **Automatic Configuration**: Bootstrap servers automatically shared between Quarkus, Camel, and Citrus
- **Real Kafka Broker**: Tests run against genuine Apache Kafka (via Testcontainers), not mocks
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Container stopped and cleaned up after test execution
- **Test Isolation**: Each test class can have its own Kafka instance if needed

This makes `@KafkaContainerSupport` an ideal solution when Quarkus Kafka Dev Services don't apply to your application architecture.

### 2. Citrus Kafka Module

The `citrus-kafka` Maven dependency is added to the Maven POM:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.citrusframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>citrus-kafka</artifactId>
    <version>${citrus.version}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

This module provides comprehensive Kafka testing capabilities:
- **Kafka Endpoint Implementations**: Full-featured producer and consumer endpoints for Citrus tests
- **Message Validation**: Validate message bodies, headers, keys, and Kafka-specific properties
- **Testcontainer Integration**: The `@KafkaContainerSupport` annotation that eliminates manual broker setup
- **Async Testing Support**: Wait for messages, timeouts, and retry logic for testing asynchronous Kafka flows
- **Gherkin-Style DSL**: Readable Given-When-Then syntax for Kafka message flows
- **Multi-Topic Testing**: Test complex scenarios involving multiple Kafka topics and partitions

### 3. Apache Camel Quarkus Dependencies

The application uses Camel Quarkus extensions:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

This provides:
- Apache Camel Kafka component for Quarkus
- Automatic configuration of Camel with Quarkus CDI
- Native image support for Camel routes
- Integration with Quarkus lifecycle management

The `quarkus-camel-bom` in dependency management ensures compatible versions of all Camel Quarkus extensions.

### 4. Citrus Container Lifecycle Listener

The test uses a custom container lifecycle listener to create Kafka topics:

```java
public static class KafkaConfigurer implements ContainerLifecycleListener<KafkaContainer> {
    @Override
    public Map<String, String> started(KafkaContainer container) {
        try (Admin adminClient = Admin.create(
                Collections.singletonMap(
                    AdminClientConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, 
                    container.getBootstrapServers()))) {
            
            CreateTopicsResult result = adminClient.createTopics(Set.of(
                new NewTopic("words-in", 1, (short) 1),
                new NewTopic("words-out", 1, (short) 1)
            ));
            
            result.all().get();
        }
        return Collections.emptyMap();
    }
}
```

**What's happening here:**

- `ContainerLifecycleListener<KafkaContainer>`: Interface that allows custom logic after container startup
- `started()` method: Called after the Kafka container has started
- Uses Kafka Admin client to create the required topics programmatically
- Creates both `words-in` and `words-out` topics with 1 partition and replication factor of 1
- This ensures topics exist before the Camel routes and Citrus tests start
- Returns empty map (no additional system properties needed)

### 5. Apache Camel Endpoint DSL

The route uses Camel's type-safe Endpoint DSL:

- `EndpointRouteBuilder` instead of `RouteBuilder` enables the endpoint DSL
- `kafka("words-in")` provides type-safe access to Kafka endpoint configuration
- `.autoOffsetReset("earliest")` ensures the consumer reads from the beginning
- Eliminates string-based URIs and provides IDE auto-completion
- Any class extending `EndpointRouteBuilder` or `RouteBuilder` in the classpath is automatically discovered by Quarkus
- Routes are started when the Quarkus application starts
- In test mode, routes are fully functional and process real messages

### 6. Kafka Configuration - Seamless Test and Production Setup

The application configuration for production:

**Production** (`application.properties`):
```properties
kafka.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092
```

**Test Configuration**

The `@KafkaContainerSupport` annotation automatically configures the bootstrap servers to point to the test Kafka broker. No test-specific `application.properties` overrides or test resources are needed - Citrus handles everything:

- **Automatic Bootstrap Server Configuration**: The testcontainer's bootstrap servers are automatically injected into the Quarkus application context
- **Framework-Agnostic**: Works seamlessly with Quarkus, Apache Camel, and any Kafka client library
- **No Property Overrides Needed**: Unlike manual testcontainer setup, you don't need to override `kafka.bootstrap.servers` in test configuration
- **Clean Separation**: Production and test configurations remain separate and clean

This is particularly valuable when Quarkus Kafka Dev Services don't automatically apply - Citrus fills that gap with minimal configuration.

### 7. Synchronous Testing of Asynchronous Camel Routes

While Camel routes process messages asynchronously, the Citrus test runs synchronously:

1. The `send()` action publishes a message to the Kafka topic
2. Camel asynchronously consumes, transforms, and produces the message
3. The `receive()` action blocks until a message arrives on the output topic (or timeout occurs)
4. This approach ensures deterministic test execution and proper verification

## Running the Tests

Execute the tests using Maven:

```bash
./mvnw clean test
```

**What happens during test execution:**

1. `@KafkaContainerSupport` starts a Kafka testcontainer (Apache Kafka 4.2.0)
2. The `KafkaConfigurer` lifecycle listener creates the `words-in` and `words-out` topics
3. Quarkus starts the application in test mode with bootstrap servers pointing to the test Kafka
4. Apache Camel routes are discovered and started
5. The Camel Kafka consumer starts reading from the `words-in` topic (from earliest offset)
6. Citrus Kafka endpoints are configured with the same bootstrap servers
7. The test sends a message with body `"Howdy"` to the `words-in` topic
8. The Camel route consumes, transforms (uppercase + prefix), and produces the message to `words-out` topic
9. Citrus receives and validates the output message matches `">> HOWDY"`
10. The test completes, and the Kafka container is automatically stopped and cleaned up

**Expected output:**
```
[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```

As the Citrus test class is an arbitrary JUnit Jupiter test you may also run the test directly from your favorite Java IDE (e.g. Eclipse or IntelliJ).

### Key Dependencies (pom.xml)

- **camel-quarkus-kafka**: Apache Camel Kafka component for Quarkus
- **quarkus-messaging-kafka**: Quarkus Kafka client and configuration support
- **citrus-quarkus**: Integrates Citrus with Quarkus test framework
- **citrus-kafka**: Adds Kafka endpoint support to Citrus
- **citrus-junit-jupiter**: JUnit 5 integration for Citrus

Note: The Kafka testcontainer support is provided by Citrus through the `@KafkaContainerSupport` annotation, so no separate testcontainer dependency is required.
